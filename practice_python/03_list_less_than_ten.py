"""
Take a list, say for example this one:

      a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
      and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that
      are less than 5.

      Extras:

          1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that
          has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out
          this new list.
          2. Write this in one line of Python.
          3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only
          elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number
          given by the user.
